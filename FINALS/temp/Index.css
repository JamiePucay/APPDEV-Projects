Played in 5v5 matches, teams alternate between attacking and defending, with Agents equipped with unique abilities and ultimates that require charging through kills, objectives, or orbs. Each round begins with players using a default pistol and signature ability charges, while additional weapons and abilities can be purchased using an in-game economy based on round performance. The game features a variety of weapons, including pistols, rifles, and shotguns, each with unique shooting patterns requiring player control for accuracy. Valorant currently offers 24 Agents, with five unlocked initially; others can be acquired using Kingdom Credits earned through gameplay or tasks. Alternatively, new Agents can be unlocked during limited periods using Valorant Points, a premium currency purchased with real money.",

It is the fourteenth main installment in the series, returning to a World War II setting after nearly a decade, and centers around a squad in the 1st Infantry Division during Operation Overlord on the Western Front. Players control Ronald 'Red' Daniels, who relies on squadmates for resources like ammo and health. The game's multiplayer introduces a new Divisions system and a social hub called Headquarters. The developers, having worked on the futuristic Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, chose to return to WWII, aiming for an authentic war experience that includes depictions of Nazi atrocities. The game received positive reviews for its story, combat, multiplayer modes, and visuals, though it was criticized for a lack of innovation in the single-player mode. A commercial success, it grossed $500 million in its first three days and over $1 billion by the end of 2017, becoming the highest-grossing console game of the year in North America.",

Instead, it returns to a more traditional 'boots on the ground' gameplay style, focusing on non-aerial ground combat. The game reintroduces an unlimited sprint mechanic, similar to previous titles, and replaces the 'slide' movement mechanic with a new 'hit-the-deck' feature. This allows players to quickly dive to the ground for cover, reminiscent of the 'dolphin dive' mechanic from Treyarch's Call of Duty: Black Ops and Black Ops II.",
